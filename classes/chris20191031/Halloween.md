## 万圣节历史及中国类似习俗

Halloween **originated** from the traditional holiday of **Celts** in Great Britain who believed that the last day of October was “the day of the dead” or “the ghost day” when ghosts crossed over the **boundary** between the living and the dead. It evolved into a day of fun and parties for most people. However, in English speaking countries such as America and Britain, many take the day seriously as a special day for religious prayers or **witchcraft**.

The Chinese days of the dead are a part of the religion of the common people. A greater percentage of Chinese than Westerners really believe that on these days there is more of a bridge between the dead and the living, and so they must take **precautions** or honour the dead.
